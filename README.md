#MinCutAlgo


An implementation of Karger's Min-Cut Algorithm and Karger-Stein Algorithm.

The example is from the open course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) named [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) by Prof. Tim [Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~214)

It may have some difference compared with the assignment online, please check the algorithm carefully.
